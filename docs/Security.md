## Implementing Permission-based authorization

The .NET framework supports a role-based authorization model, and CSLA .NET is built on top of that model. However, it is possible to implement a more granular level of permission-based authorization on this model as well.

* Here's a [forum thread](https://cslanet.com/old-forum/8432.html) with good information.
* Here's one of Rocky's [blog posts](http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/PermissionbasedAuthorizationVsRolebasedAuthorization.aspx) on the topic.
